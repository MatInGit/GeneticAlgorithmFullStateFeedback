# Genetic algorithm full state feedback control gain tool 
This was originally a course work exercise to design a full state feedback using the LQR method.
I was had encountered genetic algorithms at the time of the course and decided to implement them in order to find the optimal full-state feedback matrix and compare it to the results given by an LQR method. 
The results were decent however, as always there was area for improvement, namely the tracking delay was almost double that of the LQR.
